The increasing occurrence of cyberattacks and the rapid evolution of software vulnerabilities take a robust system for tracking and exploring vulnerabilities. 
Current challenges include:
1.	Data Availability: Difficulty in fetching, updating, and managing CVE data in real time.
2.	Search Restrictions: Limited qualifications to filter vulnerabilities by severity, dates, or descriptive keywords.
3.	Data Integrity: The need for proper validation and deduplication of fetched data.
4.	Scalability: The ability to handle growing volumes of vulnerability data efficiently.
 
This project associates these gaps by providing a Python-based solution that fetches CVE data, validates inputs, stores data in a MySQL database, and offers flexible search facilities.
